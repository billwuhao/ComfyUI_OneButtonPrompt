[2025-01-10]‚öíÔ∏è: 

- human_pose ‚Üí pose: Any subject can set pose. Please promptly change the file name `human_pose` to `pose`.

- Add 4 `add_` files to record the good prompt words I have found. You can also share your prompt words and submit an PR.

- Add `None` to `subject` to make it optional, so that custom subject can be fixed in `lora_trigger_or_prefix` to generate images under the same subject and win prizes.

- To add a testing mode, please put the prompts you need to test into the file `test.txt`(The first time you need to create a new one), and then turn on the testing mode to test each prompt in sequence. **Note**: During testing mode, all options except for the custom `lora_trigger_or_prefix` are invalid. f you are running the test automatically, after all prompts are completed, switch to a random generated image.

## Usage

- **If "human" is selected**, it will generate only the human-related prompt.
- **If "other" is selected**, it will generate only the other-related prompt.
- **If "dual_subject" is selected**, it will include both of the above.
- **If "pose" is enabled**, it will generate a subject pose prompt.
- **If "style" is enabled**, it will generate a style prompt.
- **lora_trigger_or_prefix** are optional and can be customized.
- If you have modified the custom file during the generation images, please enable **refresh** to update it, without having to restart the software
- **If the seed is fixed**, it will generate the same fixed prompt.

**Example Prompt**:  

(MW:1.2), a beautiful girl, fall asleep, A beautiful lovely alpaca, naive art

- `(MW:1.2)` is the **Lora trigger word**.
- `a beautiful girl` is the **human**.
- `fall asleep` is the **pose**.
- `A beautiful lovely alpaca` is the **other**.
- `naive art` is the **style**.

## Custom Subjects, Poses, and Styles

1. Create four files under the folder `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI_OneButtonPrompt_Flux\txtfiles`.

2. Input the corresponding content into each file to generate your custom subject, pose, and style.

3. The `prompt_words.xlsx` file contains prompts I gathered a long time ago when experimenting with **Disco Diffusion** and **SD 1.5**. You can refer to it for ideas.

**Note**: Be sure to create new files and modify them freely; this will not affect the node's functionality or future updates.

## Automatic Image Generation

If you want to automatically generate images while your computer is running, select `Queue (On Change)` and click Start. Workflow in `workflow_example`.

## Using with Prompt Enhancer

The enhancer of prompt has a poor effect in some cases, completely destroying the style and artistic conception of the prompt. It is recommended to enable it during the lottery
