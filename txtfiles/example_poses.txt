held up two fingers in victory
on horseback
read a book
guffaw
fall asleep
lie in bed
holding a samurai sword
holding the swordsman sword
have a meal
make a heart-shaped gesture
military salute
run
cry loudly
giving a thumbs up
flipping the middle finger
aiming with a finger gun
putting a finger to lips shushing
waving hand
saluting with a raised hand
stretching arms upwards
raising both arms in the air
spreading arms wide
pulling hair
showing armpits
performing a curtsy
smiling with fingers
resting chin on hand
crossing arms in front of body
squatting down
kneeling on both knees
sitting in seiza (japanese kneeling position)
sitting in wariza (legs splayed to the sides)
sitting sideways with legs to one side
sitting in indian style (cross-legged)
hugging one's own legs
leaning forward
